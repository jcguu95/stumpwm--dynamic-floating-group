;; Have a handy function to get all info of all windows in the
;; current group. Or even more, to be able to see the current state
;; of the whole group.



;; We have =window-display-height= but no =window-display-width=. ...
;; Well, =window-display-height= is broken. It doesn't really change
;; as I alter the height of my floating window.
(defun current-window-height () (slot-value (current-window) 'height))
(defun current-window-width () (slot-value (current-window) width))
;; How about #'display-current-window-info?


How to *really* change the width, height, x and y, of the current window?

(float-window-move-resize (current-window) :width 500)

;; <= I can use this to re-tile. But I have to find out what's the
;; space available for the current group. -- it's here
(xlib:screen-width (slot-value (current-screen) 'number))
(xlib:screen-height (slot-value (current-screen) 'number))




;; I want to switch focus to the next window in the current group easily.

(focus-next-window (current-group))
(focus-prev-window (current-group))
;; Have a way to switch to "full-screen" mode in a floating group.
;; In that case, all windows are full-screened. Make sure that I can
;; still switch focus to next/prev window easily. While
;; "full-screen" mode is off, all windows should be set back to
;; their original size.
