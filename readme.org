* StumpWM - Dynamic Floating Group

Usage: connect StumpWM to swank/slynk, and evaluate the file in
the repl.

** TODO

+ (X) make every function default at group = (current-group).
  make every function check if input group is a dyn-float-group.

+ ( ) Handle the case when windows are moving out and in to the
  group. Currently, moving a window from dyn-float-group to a
  tile-group causes error. Also, moving a window from another
  group to a dyn-float-group causes an error.

+ ( ) Free a window when it is controlled my mouse.

+ ( ) Add a function to print the dyn-order (state) of the
  (current) group, in order to make the development easier.

+ ( ) Emacs drop-down window.
